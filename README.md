# AssetChangeTracker-Example
Demonstration project for https://github.com/falldamagestudio/AssetChangeTracker.

This will listen for changes to any assets of type `DemoScriptableObject`, and print to the Console window whenever that happens.

Try it out by opening the example project in Unity, and manipulate `DemoScriptableObject1` and `DemoScriptableObject2`.
